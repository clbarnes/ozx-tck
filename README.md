# ozx-tck

A Technology Compatibility Toolkit for the .ozx format,
described in [RFC-9 of the OME-Zarr specification](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/rfc/9/index.html).

Generates a number of .ozx files for valid, warning, and error cases.
Implementors of .ozx should use these files to check that their own implementations can correctly validate the resulting data.
